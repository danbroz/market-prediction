 build.py
 
This script: 
defines the model structure (e.g., a scikit-learn pipeline with a random forest or gradient boosting regressor). You can expand/modify as needed. For demonstration, we use a simple pipeline with a RandomForestRegressor.

  train.py
  
This script:

Loads (or fetches) historical price data and sentiment data.

Merges them into training features (X) and labels (y).

Uses the pipeline from build.py to train the model.

Saves the trained model to disk (using pickle or joblib).

Note: In a real scenario, you’d fetch data from your chosen APIs. Below is a mock version demonstrating how to combine data from a CSV or a placeholder function.


  app.py
This script:

Fetches today’s sentiment data for each symbol (from your sentiment API).

Loads yesterday’s close price (from your market data API).

Creates the same feature structure as in training.

Loads the trained model (model.pkl).

Predicts the next day’s closing price.

(Optional) Writes predictions into a database or displays them on a web interface.


Connect to your chosen DB (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
Have an actual Flask or Django server exposing these predictions via an endpoint or a dashboard.

  stocks.csv
A minimal sample stocks.csv might look like this:

````
stock_symbol,currency_symbol,crypto_symbol,company_name
AAPL,USD,,Apple Inc.
TSLA,USD,,Tesla Inc.
